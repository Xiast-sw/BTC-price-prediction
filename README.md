# Bitcoin Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the Bitcoin prices for 2025 by analyzing historical Bitcoin price data using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The model processes daily Bitcoin closing prices and forecasts future price trends based on past data.

## Features:
- Prediction of monthly Bitcoin prices for 2025.
- Uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model for time series forecasting.
- Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.
- Scales and preprocesses data before training the model.
- Visualizes training loss and predicted vs. actual Bitcoin prices.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow (Keras)
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- yfinance
- Scikit-learn
